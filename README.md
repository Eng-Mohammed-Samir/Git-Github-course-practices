# Mastering API Testing with Mock server
### In this project i enhanced my expertise in API testing by:
#### Developed a Mock Server:
Utilized [Json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and [Json-server-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server-auth) to create a mock server with mock APIs to replicate various endpoints and responses, simulating real-world API behavior for testing purposes.
#### Comprehensive API Testing:
Conducted API tests by exploring various scenarios and E2E tests through hands-on practice with variables, test scripts and implementing assertions to validate responses and ensure reliability.
#### Manual Execution:
Executed API collections manually using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
#### Automated Execution:
Automated API collection execution using [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) for efficiency and consistency.
#### Reporting:
Generated HTML report using [Newman-reporter-htmlextra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman-reporter-htmlextra) summarizing the results of the automated collection runs for better analysis and documentation.
